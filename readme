## General Information
All models are stored in CAD_models folder, all the python code are stored in Code folder.

Ideally each of us should be putting our individual functions in their own files so whenever 
    we merge there's less hussle. See the Code folder for reference.

Everyone actively working on any aspect of the project should, ideally, downloaded the repo to
    their own machine and work on their local version. After finished we will merge everything to 
    the main branch. (I'm not great at github so we will see when time comes.)

Any suggestions and ideas for improve the structure is welcomed, just leave a quick message in
    our group chat. Good luck all.

## How To Manage File Input and Output
In the main file os.chdir() and os.path.dirname() were used to change the working directory to where ever 
    the main file is. When outputing/reading file to/from Content folder, put the following path before 
    the file name "./content/[the file you are looking for]".
