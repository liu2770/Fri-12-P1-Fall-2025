/*
This is the change log file, now for each individual commit and whatever github would ask you to put some comment 
when you do it. This file is just a backup/quick reference. We will see how well it works, if it's too much hussle
to merge we will trash this file. 
There's no standard notation, just keep it casual and to the point.
